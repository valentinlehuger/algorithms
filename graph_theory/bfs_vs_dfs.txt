BFS Breadth First Search
DFS Depth First Search

BFS and DFS look for all child node from a source node in a graph.
The difference is that the BFS crawl the graph horizontally and
the DFS vertically.
In code, the difference is that at a source node, the BFS add the child nodes in a FIFO
and the DFS in a LIFO and goes in recursive in the next node in their queue.
